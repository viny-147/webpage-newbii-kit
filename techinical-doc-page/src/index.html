             <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
           </p>
           <p>
             Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
           </p>
           <p>
             HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
           </p>
           <p>
             HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

        <h2>What does HTML satnds for?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            HTML stands for <strong>HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</strong><br>
            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s

        <h2>HTML Tags</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as:
          </p><br>
          <p>
             head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside, audio, canvas, datalist, details, embed, nav, output, progress, video, ul, ol, li and many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "&lt;" and "&gt;".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the &lt;title&gt; tag can be written as &lt;Title&gt;, &lt;TITLE&gt;, or in any other way.

          <h3>Text displaying</h3>
          In HTML we can display text, pragraph, headings, and also add colors to them for now we can see how to display some text on your browser. Follow the upcoming syntax code for printing text on your browser.<br><hr>
          
             <code>
            &lt;!--Heading tags--&gt;<br>
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading one&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
            
            &lt;h2&gt;Heading two&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
            
            &lt;h3&gt;Heading three&lt;/h3&gt;<br>
            &lt;!--Paragraph tags--&gt;<br>

          <h3>CORS enabled image</h3>
          <p>
The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the &lt;img&gt; element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a &lt;canvas&gt; element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.
             </p>
          <h3>CORS settings attributes</h3>
          <p>
Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as &lt;img&gt; or &lt;video&gt;, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
          </p>
          <h3>Preloading content with rel="preload"</h3>
          <p>
The preload value of the &lt;link&gt; element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML &lt;head&gt;, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works.
